
# 🌍 **DAY 1 — PART 1.1**

# **JavaScript Foundations + Ecosystem + Node.js Intro**

This is the “orientation day.”
Before we write code, we first understand **what JavaScript *is***,
**where it runs**,
**why Node.js was created**,
**what npm is**, and
**how everything connects in modern development**.

Let’s begin.

---

# 🧠 **1.1.1 — What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript (JS) is a **programming language** originally created to make web pages interactive.

Think:

* Clicking buttons
* Showing popups
* Handling forms
* Animations
* Updating content without reloading

JavaScript is:

* **High-level** (easy to read)
* **Dynamic** (no need to declare strict types)
* **Interpreted** (browser runs it directly)
* **Single-threaded** (processes one task at a time)
* **Event-driven** (reacts to actions like click, scroll, input)

And most importantly:

### 🟩 **JS is the only language browsers understand natively.**

HTML = structure
CSS = design
JavaScript = behavior

---

# 🧩 **1.1.2 — The JavaScript Ecosystem**

“Ecosystem” basically means **everything around JavaScript** that helps it work in the real world.

### The JS ecosystem includes:

### ✔ Browsers

Chrome, Firefox, Safari…
Each has a **JavaScript engine** that executes your code.

Examples of engines:

* Chrome → **V8 engine**
* Firefox → **SpiderMonkey**
* Safari → **JavaScriptCore**

---

### ✔ Node.js

A runtime that allows JS to run **outside the browser**.

We’ll explain this in detail soon.

---

### ✔ npm (Node Package Manager)

A huge library of tools, utilities, and frameworks written in JavaScript.

Examples:

* react
* express
* lodash
* axios

---

### ✔ Frameworks and Libraries

Used for building large apps easily.

Frontend:

* React
* Vue
* Angular

Backend:

* Express
* NestJS
* Fastify

---

### ✔ Tools / Bundlers

* Vite
* Webpack
* Babel
* Parcel

These tools help optimise JS for production.

---

### So the JS ecosystem = **JS + Engines + Node + npm + Tools + Frameworks**

---

# ❗ **1.1.3 — JavaScript Does NOT Work Outside the Browser (Initially)**

Originally, JS **could only run inside a web browser**.

Meaning:

* You cannot run JS directly in a terminal (without Node).
* You cannot run JS directly on a server.
* You cannot build backend apps with JS.

Chrome, Firefox & other browsers include a **built-in JS engine** that runs your code.

### Without a browser, JS has no environment to run in.

Example:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

This will NOT run on your PC unless you run it inside:

* A browser console, or
* Node.js

So developers needed a way to run JavaScript **outside browsers**.

---

# 🚀 **1.1.4 — Introduction to Node.js**

Node.js is a **runtime environment** created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl.
It uses Chrome’s **V8 JavaScript engine** but runs it **outside the browser**.

### In simple words:

> Node.js allows JavaScript to run on your computer like Python or C.

With Node.js, you can:

* Build backend servers
* Interact with files
* Create APIs
* Read/write databases
* Build command-line tools

### Node.js ≠ JavaScript

JavaScript is the language.
Node.js is an environment that *runs* that language.

---

# 🌟 **1.1.5 — Why Node.js Exists (Why It’s Useful)**

Before Node.js:

* JavaScript was only frontend
* Backend needed PHP, Java, Python, etc.

Node.js changed the game by making JavaScript **fullstack**.

### Benefits:

✔ Same language for frontend + backend
✔ Huge community + packages (npm)
✔ Fast (built on V8 engine)
✔ Perfect for real-time apps (chats, games)
✔ Non-blocking, asynchronous nature makes it extremely scalable

# 🛠️ **1.1.6 — Installing Node.js & npm**

### 1. Visit:

[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Download the **LTS version** (recommended for beginners).

### 2. After installation:

Open **terminal / CMD** and check:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see something like:

```
v20.x.x
10.x.x
```

### 3. Create your first JS file:

Create a file:

```
hello.js
```

Write:

```js
console.log("Hello from Node.js!");
```

Run it in terminal:

```bash
node hello.js
```

🎉 You just executed JavaScript outside the browser.

---

# 📦 **1.1.7 — What is npm?**

npm = **Node Package Manager**

It is installed *automatically* when you install Node.js.

It gives you:

* Millions of open-source JS libraries
* Tools like React, Express, Tailwind, Vite, etc.
* The ability to install and manage dependencies

Example:

```bash
npm install express
```

This installs Express framework in your project.

---

# 🔁 **1.1.8 — How Node.js Handles JavaScript**

Node.js uses:

* **V8 engine** → executes JS fast
* **libuv** → provides async features (event loop, file system, network handling)

### JavaScript alone cannot handle:

❌ File system
❌ Network requests (outside browser)
❌ Databases
❌ Server sockets

Node.js provides all of this through **APIs + modules**, like:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const os = require("os");
```

---

# 🆚 **1.1.9 — Alternatives to Node.js**

These are environments that run JavaScript on servers, NOT browsers:

### ✔ **Deno**

Created by same founder of Node.js
Modern, secure by default
Supports TypeScript out of the box

### ✔ **Bun**

Fastest JS runtime
Built on Zig
Includes bundler + test runner

### ✔ **Cloudflare Workers**

Runs JS on the edge
Super fast distributed runtime
