**Goal:** See how elements behave naturally.

* Create a few `<div>` and `<span>` elements.
* Give each a background color and some padding.
* Observe how `div` takes the full width while `span` only fits its content.
* Then switch the `display` of your `<div>` to `inline` and `<span>` to `block` to see the change.

#### **Task 2 — Inline-Block Navigation Bar**

**Goal:** Create a navbar with items side by side using `display: inline-block`.

* Create a `<nav>` with several `<a>` elements.
* Use `inline-block` to line them up horizontally.
* Add hover effects and spacing.

#### **Task 3 — Table-Based Card Layout**

**Goal:** Use `display: table`, `table-row`, and `table-cell` to simulate a layout.

* Create a parent div with `display: table`.
* Inside, make `div` children as `table-cell`.
