# Start with Git and Github

## 1) Install Git (Windows / macOS / Linux)

This is the easy “get the tool” part.

**Windows**
Download from: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
Open installer → keep most defaults.
Two important screens:
• Choose **Git from command line and also from 3rd-party software**
• Choose **main branch** as default for new repos
Done.

**macOS**
Just install **Xcode Command Line Tools**:

```
xcode-select --install
```

OR download Git from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

**Linux**

```
sudo apt install git
```

or

```
sudo yum install git
```

## 2) Configure Git (identifying the human)

Git acts like a historian. It needs to know *who’s writing history*.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

You can confirm:

```
git config --global --list
```

This information gets attached to every commit.

---

## 3) Create a GitHub Account + Setup

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create an account
3. Set username + email
4. Enable 2FA later (not mandatory for interns, but a good practice)

---

## 4) Create SSH Key (optional but best practice)

This is how your computer proves to GitHub, “Yes, it’s me.”

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
```

Press Enter → Enter → Enter.

Then show the key:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy it → GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → Add New → Paste.

Tell GitHub:

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you get a “Hi <username>!” then the handshake has happened.

---

## 5) Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Click **New Repo**
2. Give name: `sample-project`
3. Choose **Public** or **Private**
4. Check **Add README.md**
5. Create Repository

You now have your first “cloud folder”.

---

## 6) Clone the Repository to Local Machine

This downloads the cloud folder to the computer.

Copy the repo URL (SSH preferred).

```
git clone git@github.com:username/sample-project.git
```

Now a folder appears:

```
cd sample-project
```

Everything your interns do next happens **inside** this folder.

---

## 7) Basic Git Lifecycle (the holy trinity)

Let’s demystify the core idea:

Your files exist in 3 zones:

**1. Working Directory** — you changed something
**2. Staging Area** — you are preparing what will go into commit
**3. Repository** — officially saved snapshot

The 3 steps:

```
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

---

## 8) Example: Add a File & Push to GitHub

Let’s say they create `index.html`.

They run:

```
git status
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index file"
git push
```

Their change appears on GitHub instantly.

---

## 9) Pulling Code (updating from cloud)

If someone else pushed code, they should update their local machine.

```
git pull
```

This merges new changes from GitHub into their machine.

---

## 10) Common Beginner Mistakes (and quick fixes)

**“I can’t push – permission denied”**
→ They used HTTPS instead of SSH. Re-clone using SSH.

**“Merge conflicts happened??”**
→ Means two humans edited same lines.
Explain conflict markers:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
their version
=======
your version
>>>>>>> main
```

Let them pick, clean, save, then:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
git push
```

**“Nothing happens when I push”**
→ They forgot to add or commit.

---

## 11) Branching (the superhero move)

Simple words:
A branch is a universe copy of your project.

Create:

```
git checkout -b feature-login
```

Switch:

```
git checkout main
```

Merge:

```
git merge feature-login
```

Push the branch:

```
git push --set-upstream origin feature-login
```

---

## 12) Final Good Practices for Interns

• Commit often, commit small.
• Write meaningful commit messages.
• Pull before you start your work every day.
• Never work directly on `main`.
• Branch → Code → Commit → Push → Merge via Pull Request.
